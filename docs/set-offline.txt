Setting Maintenance OptionsTop
SSH into the node you want to take down
Run these 3 commands to set flags on the cluster to prepare for offlining a node.
root@osd1:~# ceph osd set noout 
root@osd1:~# ceph osd set norebalance 
root@osd1:~# ceph osd set norecover
 

Run ceph -s to see the cluster is in a warning state and that the 3 flags have been set.
root@osd1:~# ceph -s


Now that the flags are set, it is safe to reboot/shutdown the node.
root@osd1:~# shutdown now

root@osd1:~# reboot
Disabling Maintenance OptionsTop
Once the system is back up and running and joined to the cluster unset the 3 flags we previously set.
root@osd1:~# ceph osd unset noout
root@osd1:~# ceph osd unset norebalance
root@osd1:~# ceph osd unset norecover
